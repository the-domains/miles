**BREAKING NEWS: Santa Claus gets life after an investigation into an incident of drunk driving caused detectives to look more closely at his activities.**

The fiend was caught red handed when an off duty policeman witnessed Mr. Claus, age 1744 years, delivering presents while heavily inebriated, the authorities have now linked this to Mr. Claus consuming an illegal amount of alcohol offered by families.

Fat Cat Santa has also been exposed as a stalker, observing children in their sleep and taking notes of what times they wake up, then putting them on a "naughty or nice list". Though the police have said that rich families need only bribe Old Man Christmas, answering the age old question of why the rich kids always get the best presents.

After taking the Christmas Gnome in for questioning the police got a vet to test his reindeer for any signs 0f mistreatment, and discovered the gruesome truth that he had been giving his, supposedly "magical", reindeer performance enhancing drugs. The vet, Mrs. Bullock, commented, "Rudolph's red nose was a clear indicator of long term drug abuse. It breaks my heart to imagine what these poor animals have been going through."

The Judge said that he had had no choice other than to sentence Saint Nick to life due to the glaring evidence for millions upon millions of cases of illegal entry into homes. Circumstantial evidence shows that Godfather Frost has also been stealing from the houses he visits, a textbook example of distraction burglary. This has been described as the biggest case of organised crime history has ever witnessed.

Police have voiced concerns that Pere Noel will not be given time for speeding on a technicality, due to the fact that no machine currently in existence is capable of measuring his speed, and so no charges can be made.

Officials have now managed to locate the Christmas Brownie's hideout, and were horrified to discover hundreds of young children in low quality elf makeup. This offence of child slavery is the most monstrous of his known crimes, and in itself will easily justify life imprisonment. These children have now been placed under the care of social services, and will now have a Christmas. The RSPCC have launched a new campaign called a Christmas for the elves.

Scores of countries around the world are asking questions concerning breaches in their air space. North Korean officials have said, "These frequent and planned incursions into our air space will not be tolerated, we will shoot down anything and anyone who illegally enters our air space, and are updating our systems to detect more of Santa's known accomplices, make no mistake we will use deadly force." Dozens of extradition requests across the world are now pending.

Saint Nicholas was known to have many friends in high places, such as Obama and Putin, who are now desperately trying to distance themselves from him, claiming ignorance of all his crimes.
